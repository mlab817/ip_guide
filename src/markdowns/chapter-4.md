## Chapter 4 The Market and Market-Oriented Public Investment Programming

The Routledge Dictionary of Economics defines market as a “medium for exchanges between buyers and sellers.”  The exchange sometimes happens in a physical location, the marketplace.  It can also take place through an elaborate web of middlemen or even through cyberspace.  It does not mean though that market-oriented public investment programming is about constructing markets nor does it mean government going into buying and selling.

When we talk of being market-oriented, the field of specialization that comes to mind is Marketing rather than Economics.  Marketing, according to Perreault, Jr. and McCarthy (1999) goes beyond the commonplace notion of selling and advertising.  It is better understood by looking at the two main aspects of marketing – micro-marketing and macro-marketing, defined as follows:

Micro-marketing is the performance of activities that seek to accomplish an organization’s objectives by anticipating customer or client needs and directing a flow of need-satisfying goods and services from producer to customer or client.

Macro-marketing is a social process that directs an economy’s flow of goods and services from producers to consumers in a way that effectively matches supply and demand and accomplishes the objectives of society.

Another definition (NHH, 1997) states that “Macromarketing is also concerned with the study of marketing systems, the interaction of multiple firms in value chains, networks and the like.”  This means that starting from the final product, we break it down into component parts and then trace the origins of these parts and how they come together to form the final product.  We need to be aware of the value addition at each point.  Now this exercise is not new to the Department.  In 2002, the DA has come up with the cost structure of a number of commodities.  What needs to be added is the number and identity of the firms that figure in the chain.  We need to promote the “many buyers, many sellers” situation, to the extent possible.

We now define what we mean by “market-oriented public investment programming for the agriculture sector.”  

Market-oriented public investment programming is the task of formulating the broad, aggregate portfolio of public investments, where the portfolio is composed of goods and services necessary for government to perform its functions of promoting efficiency of agricultural marketing systems, equity among the different stakeholders in the agriculture sector (producers, consumers, traders, etc.), stability in the supply and demand of agricultural commodities (especially food) and representation in the international community, all in support of optimal rural and agricultural growth. 

### Challenges in Undertaking Market-Oriented Public Investment Programming for the Agriculture Sector

In undertaking market-oriented public investment programming, the public investment programmer needs to balance the needs and wants between and among the producers, consumers and traders.  Following are the realities in the Philippine agricultural sector that make this a challenging task:

1.	While it is true that the sector employs about 40% of the labor force, thereby having a large production sector, many of these produce at subsistence or only slightly above subsistence level.  Being subsistence producers, they cannot really be considered as market players.  

2.	The main output of the agriculture sector is food, a most basic need.  Food constitutes a big chunk of spending among the poor.  The objective therefore is to bring down the price of food.  The problem, however, is that farmers and fisherfolk are the poorest sectors in the country.  To be more specific, about 4.2 million families depend on agriculture for their incomes.  This translates to 21 million individuals in 2003.  Thus, to address this latter problem, we should actually discourage food prices from falling.

3.	Poverty incidence in the Philippines remains high, 33% by official statistics.  This means that 1 in every 3 individuals do not really have much spare income to spend on high value food commodities.  They will prefer to spend their meager income on staples, first, then on inexpensive food to go with the staples, next.  This makes the Philippine market a thin market for high value food commodities .

4.	The Philippines is an archipelago with very diverse topography, hence, the scattered location of agricultural areas for specific crops.  The transport and infrastructure network is very inadequate, hence the difficulty of trading.  The high transaction cost hinders the workings of an efficient marketing system.

5.	Food is a most basic need and ensuring food safety is a major task of government.  Part of the function of marketing is grading and standardization, but this will entail higher costs given the scattered location of production centers.

6.	The policy environment concerning land imposes restrictions on the agricultural land market.  But there is pressure from a growing population for the use of the land especially for residential purposes.  Presently, there have been anecdotes about unauthorized conversions of agricultural lands, though undocumented.  In the future, the pressure may be so great as to result in the deregulation of the land market.  This should be factored in the investment program.

### Steps in Market-Oriented Public Investment Programming

Following are the major steps in market-oriented public investment programming:  
- Understand the setting
- Know your market 
- Model the chain and identify needed interventions
- Prioritize interventions

#### Understand the Setting

This step describes profile of the agriculture sector and its major subsectors in relation to the rest of the economy.  In addition to the performance, we are also interested in efficiency indicators.

#### Know your market

An appropriate rephrasing of this step is “Know your clients”.  As far as the DA is concerned, the clients are the consumers and producers of agricultural commodities.  In the next chapters, we label these steps as “Know your farmers’ market” and “Know your farmers”.  By “farmers”, we mean all sectors involved in agricultural sector production – farmers, livestock and poultry raisers, fishermen, etc.  

#### Model the chain and identify needed interventions

We extend the previous step by tracing the chain that links the “farmers” to the “farmers’ market.”  This step should include information on the quantity and quality of every crucial link in the chain.  We then identify the weak links based on the information alongside the needed interventions

#### Screen and prioritize public interventions
The interventions listed above will not necessarily require public provision.  They will need to undergo screening and prioritization given the scarcity of fiscal resources.  And for this, we can derive guidance from the NEDA screening and prioritization protocol.  Better yet, a protocol that considers the unique characteristics of the country’s agriculture sector can be developed.

Note that the Framework on the 5 Pillars of Agricultural Development has set out the goal of public intervention in the agriculture sector.  To reiterate, the goal is to ensure profitability of stakeholders – better prices for producers and consumers alike.
