## Chapter 8 Screening and Prioritization of Public Investments

Specific to a food item and geographical location, we have identified the objectives of the intervention and have suggested the corresponding subMFOs (Refer to Table 14) and the projects.  If there is no constraint on resources, then this list already constitutes the public investment program.  However, fiscal resources are scarce so that these projects/subprojects need to be subjected to screening and prioritization.  We evaluate the projects according to two broad parameters – effectiveness and efficiency.  By effectiveness, we mean the extent by which the objectives and goals are met by the interventions, i.e., actual vs. desired outcomes.  By efficiency, we mean the cost of the interventions, i.e., input (in pesos) per unit output or even input (in pesos) per unit outcome and output (in pesos) per unit outcome.

There may seem to be a conflict between the effectiveness and efficiency criteria.  The efficiency criterion forces us to prioritize “near-shelf” interventions while the effectiveness criterion requires that even the “seed” and “post-seed” processes are functioning properly.  Actually, they can reinforce each other.  Near-shelf interventions may provide the incentives for private producers to improve the productivity (or efficiency) of their seed and post-seed processes.  Meanwhile, productive seed and post-seed processes increase the effectiveness of near-shelf interventions.

Given the unique characteristics of the agriculture sector relative to the rest of the economy, as indicated in Chapter 4, it is advisable to develop a different set of screening and prioritization criteria.  The following is a suggestion, taking off from the points discussed in the previous chapters.

### Screening

The objective of this procedure is to screen out “projects” that do not merit private provision.  The first step is to identify the output that the project will provide.  The second is to characterize this output.  Chapter 2 can be used as guide.  The following series of questions summarizes the considerations:

- Can the output be packaged commercially? 
  Note that to merit public provision, the answer to the previous question should be a NO.  If the answer is YES, we need to resolve the following issues next:
  
- Will it be profitable to private farmers and/or entrepreneurs?  At what price should the output be sold for it to be an attractive commercial undertaking?  

- At this price, will consumers be able to afford it?  What is the adverse effect if the intended beneficiaries will not “buy” the good or service?

- Is there enough private capital to undertake the investment to produce the output?

- Just how soon can private investment be expected to start?

- What public interest should be guarded and how can compliance be monitored?
  Note that if non-consumption of the good would not result in adverse effects, then the project need not be undertaken by government.  Consider an R&D project to increase the yield of rice and another to increase the yield of mangoes.  If the R&D for rice is not undertaken and given the dwindling area of farms planted to rice alongside the ever-increasing demand for rice (and the not so rapid growth in the non-agriculture sector), we will be confronted with serious food security problems, probably even hunger and malnutrition.  On the other hand, the impact of not undertaking R&D for mangoes will not be as bad and as far-reaching.     

We should be able to characterize the output into one of four: national public good, local public good, mixed good, private good.  The subsequent steps are:
1. If (national) public good, proceed to prioritization.
2. If local public good, require LGU counterpart.  If LGU is willing to provide counterparty, then proceed to prioritization.  If otherwise, it is not advisable to proceed with the project.  Public provision by NG is bound to be inefficient.
3. If mixed good, the next step is to determine willingness of the private sector (producers of the good) to pay for the good.  If cost recovery is possible, say over the medium term, then prioritization can proceed.  Otherwise, public provision is not warranted.
4. If private good, we need to characterize the producers of the good who will directly benefit from the project’s output.  If they belong to the priority sector, then prioritization may proceed.  The priority sector may consist of farmers whose crop choices have been constrained by public policy, say the coconut farmers, farms within the national irrigation system, etc.  Otherwise, the appropriate policy is to encourage private provision.

The following flowcharts summarize the screening procedure.

### AFMA Priorities

Before discussing the prioritization procedure, it is important to re-visit the strategies outlined in RA 8435, also known as the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA).  This provides the basic guidelines to DA’s investment programming, especially in the aspect of specifying budget envelopes for certain public intervention.

The law mandates the allocation of Php 20 billion for the 1st year implementation of the strategies indicated in the AFMA.  RA 9281 amended Section 112 of the AFMA to ensure continuing fiscal support to the AFMA strategies, at least until 2015, in the amount of not less than Php 17 billion annually.  

The first year allocation is as follows:

1. Thirty percent (30%) for irrigation;
2. Ten percent (10%) for post-harvest facilities: Provided, That the Secretary of Agriculture may invest up to fifty percent (50%) of the said amount to fund post-harvest facilities of cooperatives, especially market vendors' cooperatives, where said cooperatives exist and are operational: Provided, further; That if no cooperatives are operational, said amount shall fund the post-harvest facilities of the market-assistance system;    
3. Ten percent (10%) for other infrastructure including fishports, seaports, and airports, farm-and coast-to-market roads, rural energy, communications infrastructure, watershed rehabilitation, water supply system, research and technology infrastructure, public markets and abattoirs;    
4. Ten percent (10%) for the Agro-industry Modernization Credit and Financing Program (AMCFP) to be deposited by the Department in participating rural-based public and private financial institutions provided that no less than fifty percent (50%) of said funds shall be deposited in the rural banks and cooperative banks;    
5. Eight percent (8%) for the implementation of the Farmer-Fisherfolk Marketing Assistance System and support of market vendors' cooperatives.    
6. Ten percent (10%) for research and development, four percent (4%) of which shall be used to support the Biotechnology Program;     
7. Five percent (5%) for capability-building of farmers and fisherfolk organizations and LGUs for the effective implementation of the agriculture and fisheries programs at the local level;    
8. Six percent (6%) for salary supplement of Extension Workers under the LGUs.    
9. Five percent (5%) for NAFES, for the upgrading of the facilities of State Universities and Colleges that will be chosen as national centers of excellence in agriculture and fisheries education;    
10. Four percent (4%) for the National Information Network (NIN) consisting of both the national and local levels;    
11. One-and-three-fourth percent (1.75%) for SUC - and TESDA administered Rural Non-Farm Employment Training; and    
12. One-fourth percent (0.25%) for the identification of the SAFDZs.     

The law also stipulates certain criteria for selection and prioritization:

For Irrigation Development
1. Technical feasibility;    
2. Cost-effectiveness;    
3.	Affordability, low investment cost per unit area;    
4.	Sustainability and simplicity of operation;    
5.	Recovery of operation and maintenance cost;    
6.	Efficiency in water use;    
7.	Length of gestation period, and    
8.	Potential for increasing unit area productivity. 

For rural infrastructure
1.	Agro-industrial potential of the area;    
2.	Socio-economic contributions of the investments in the area;    
3.	Absence of public investment in the area; and    
4.	Presence of agrarian reform beneficiaries and other small farmers and fisherfolk in the area. 

The law also mandates the evaluation of the other strategies such as R&D, education, extension, etc. as well as AFMA itself.  

Suppose we assume that the 1st year allocation formula reflects the needs of the agriculture sector and the priorities of the government.  Perhaps, we can use this as guidance to develop an allocation formula for the years to follow, as in the following:

Table 15.  Public Investment 1st year Allocation Formula as stated in the AFMA

| Public Investment Component | Alloc for 1st year |	Strategy for the remaining years |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------| 
| Irrigation | 30	| To be determined |
| Post harvest facilities | 10 | To be determined
| Other infrastructure | 10	| To be determined
| Credit | 10	| Can be downscaled
| Farmer-Fisherfolk Marketing Assistance System and Support of Market Vendors' Cooperatives |	8	| Phase out mode
| Research and development | 10	| Continuing intervention
| Capability-building of Farmers and Fisherfolk Organizations and LGUs |	5	| Phase out mode
| Salary supplement of Extension Workers under the LGUs | 6	| Continuing intervention
| NAFES | 5 |	Continuing intervention
| National Information Network | 4	| Can be downscaled
| SUC - and TESDA administered Rural Non-Farm Employment Training	| 1.75	|Can be downscaled
| Identification of the SAFDZs | 0.25	| Can be discontinued

In the first column, we simply list down the public investment components given in the AFMA.  The corresponding 1st year allocation is given in the second column.  We now make inferences on what the strategy will be for the remaining years.

First off, we can limit the allocation for credit and discontinue the allocation for the identification of the SAFDZs.  The former is meant to be a seed fund and proper management will ensure some revolving amount.  In the 5-Pillars program, the strategy is to tap the private sector for much of the required funds.  Meanwhile, the latter is meant to be a one-time project.

Assistance for farmer and fisherfolk organizations and market vendors’ cooperatives can still be undertaken, but on a phase-out mode.  Continuous assistance extended to these groups will conflict with the intention of empowering them.  The strategy should be enhanced but with a clear timeline for phase down, then a phase out.

Meanwhile, we can downscale the allocation for the NIN and SUC- and TESDA-administered Rural Non-Farm Employment Training.  In the case of the former, the funds are needed only for maintenance of the network and information systems.  In the case of the latter, we expect some degree of saturation of the target market, after about 8 years of implementation. 

With respect to irrigation, other infrastructure and postharvest facilities, we have yet to determine how much more is needed.

Meanwhile, R&D, support to the NAFES and salary supplementation for extension workers can be a continuing strategy.  However, the allocation can be so designed as to encourage effectiveness and excellence in performance.

Suppose we adopt the arbitrary cut of 50% on the components that either be downscaled or phased out.  We maintain the % allocation for irrigation, postharvest and other infrastructure.  We work with the total amount of Php 17 billion and use R&D as the residual component (that is, it will absorb whatever is in excess after we have allocated monies to the other components).  The allocation or budget envelops will then resemble the following:

Table 15.  Public Investment 1st year Allocation Formula as stated in the AFMA

Public Investment Component | Alloc for 1st year |	Alloc for next years |	Amount in million pesos
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------| ------------|
| Irrigation | 30 |	30 |	5,100.00
Post harvest facilities | 10 | 	10 |	1,700.00
Other infrastructure | 10	| 10 |	1,700.00
Credit | 10	 | 2	| 340.00
Farmer-Fisherfolk Marketing Assistance System and Support of Market Vendors' Cooperatives	| 8	| 2	| 340.00
Research and development | 10 |	29.62 |	5,035.40
Capability-building of Farmers and Fisherfolk Organizations and LGUs |	5	| 2.5 |	425.00
Salary supplement of Extension Workers under the LGUs | 6	| 6	| 1,020.00
NAFES | 5	| 5	| 850.00
National Information Network | 4	| 2	 | 340.00
SUC – and TESDA administered Rural Non-Farm Employment Training |	1.75 |	0.88 |	149.60
Identification of the SAFDZs |  0.25 |	0	| 0

### Prioritization

Before discussing the prioritization step, let us first  reiterate that we define market-oriented public investment programming as the task of formulating the broad, aggregate portfolio of public investments, where the portfolio is composed of goods and services necessary for government to perform its functions of promoting efficiency of agricultural marketing systems, equity among the different stakeholders in the agriculture sector (producers, consumers, traders, etc.), stability in the supply and demand of agricultural commodities (especially food) and representation in the international community, all in support of optimal rural and agricultural growth.

Even with the budget envelops stipulated in the (modified) AFMA, we still need to subject the identified subprojects to prioritization.  Needless to say, only subprojects that passed the screening will undergo prioritization.  The results of the analyses done in the previous chapters will be used as inputs.  We consider the effectiveness and the efficiency of the subproject.  The table below gives the suggested parameters and their corresponding scores.

| Parameter | 	Score |
| ----------- | ------------ | 
| Effectiveness (60%)	 | |
|  Commodity being produced  | |	
|    Food security commodity |						15 |
|    Tradeable commodity |						  	15 |
|    Priority commodity other than classified above			 |	30 |
|  Production area  	| |
| Priority in terms of yield potential  	|	10
| Priority in terms of yield gap		|	10
| Priority in terms of least transport cost to priority demand destination |	5
| Area has limited production choices			|		5
| | |
| Efficiency  (40%) | |	
| Cost of the Intervention | |	
| Unit cost (cost per unit coverage) |	8 |
| Recoverable cost (cost less local/private counterpart per unit coverage) |	12 |
| Incidence of Benefits of the intervention | |  	
| Near-shelf |	7.5 |
| Direct benefits extend to other agricultural commodities |			7.5 |
| Direct benefits extend to non-agricultural sector	|		5 |

The suggested criteria assign more weight to the characteristics of the commodity that will benefit from the subproject, consistent with the primary goal of DA to ensure food security for all.  Priority is given to commodities that qualify as food security crop or any of the prioritized products of the department.

Another important consideration is the characteristic of the farm producing the commodity, again in relation to achieving food security.  More weight is given if the area/farm has potential of addressing the problem at least cost.

Next, we consider the cost of the interventions, including plans for full or partial cost recovery.  The subproject with the least cost is given the higher weight. 

Finally, we consider the incidence of benefits to determine if the subproject will result in efficiency gains.  Near-shelf interventions encourage private initiative.  Projects that benefit other commodities and/or even the non-agriculture sector imply higher social benefits.

Annex XXX is the suggested template for subproject proposal brief to facilitate the evaluation.
