## Chapter 7 Model the Chain and Identify Interventions

We now trace the chain that links the market to our farmers.  Essentially, we are interested in describing the marketing arrangements.

The usual procedure is to follow the seed-to-shelf paradigm.  If the farmer is conscious of and is guided by this paradigm, we usually say that he has a market orientation.  With respect to investment programming, however, it is easier to trace the link if we begin with the market.  Now, this step takes some time to conduct and needs to be done for every agricultural commodity.  It is important, therefore, to identify first the priority agricultural commodities for which this will be done.  

We recommend prioritizing the staple food of the poor and farms with inflexible crop choices.  We can limit the list to only the top 5 or even 10.  We can be a bit more sophisticated and identify 1 or 2 “staple food of the poor” items corresponding to each major food group – cereals, meat products, vegetables, fruits.  The rest of the food items can be ranked according to their share in the food budget of the nonpoor in the non-agriculture sector.  For labeling, let us call this latter group the “non priority” commodities.  Note that this labeling and ranking can be done for each province.

Identify the Demand Destinations

The next step is to identify the priority markets (as identified by location) of the priority goods.  As an example, we consider the markets for rice, corn and fish – the commodities that are considered staple food of the poor in the previous section.  The next tables rank the provinces according to the size of the market.  Note that this pertains only to the bottom 30%.  In other words, these are the provinces where the “cheap” products should be sold.  We again clarify that “cheapness” should not come at the expense of food safety.  For instance, increased production will also result in lower prices, but in order not to compromise farmers’ incomes, it is better to increase production by improving productivity.

### Trace the chain

In each province and for each priority commodity, ideally, we should describe the marketing arrangements - size, location, prevailing unit price:

- major retail outlets
- wholesale outlets
- major traders, trading facilities
- storage facilities
- agri-processing (for processed foods)
- agro-industrial firms (for industrial crops)

The NSO collects price data in every major retail outlet while the BAS collects data on farmgate prices in their sample farms.   We can assemble these data as a geographic information system (GIS) and present it in a map.  For sure, there will be differences between the first and final points of sales.  On average, intermediate inputs (including transport and communication) make up one-third the cost of the “output” of trade.  The pure profit is about 40% of total cost .  What this means is that there will probably be no trade in places where the average mark-up will be less than this.  We can then classify the areas where trade is likely and highly unlikely.

Figure 5.  Decision Flowchart of an Abbreviated Supply Chain

![figure 5](statics/figure_5.png)

Tracing the chain can be a bid tedious and there is always a tendency to “branch out” too much.  The flowchart given above can help identify scope of the chain.

Three sets of data are needed (at the minimum): (1) current supply, (2) potential supply, and (3) demand.  Needless to say, the food commodity for which the chain is being traced has to be pre-identified.  The demand and supply, meanwhile, can be determined at three levels: within the vicinity (province), around the vicinity (neighboring provinces or perhaps within the region), outside the vicinity (neighboring regions).          

At every point, we need to compare demand and supply.  If demand within the province is greater than the supply found within the province, then we consider other points where supply can be sourced.  If upon aggregation over all supply points, we find that it can meet aggregate demand, then the intervention should concern marketing and transport.  One advantage of addressing this is the obvious externality benefits even to the non-agriculture sector.  This will increase the benefit stream and possibly the internal rate of return.  

If we have already exhausted all points in the supply chain within the country and if this is still found insufficient, we need to trace if the problem is due to production or post-production bottlenecks.  If there is a yield gap, then the problem can be traced to the production process.  If there is no yield gap, then the problem arises after production.  Sometimes the problem may be due to intrinsic factors like soil conditions, climate, topography, etc.  R&D may be needed to address these, but especially in the short term, an alternative is to tap the international market for supply.

If, on the other hand, demand is less than supply, we need to penetrate new markets, possibly at the next point where there is ample demand, or create effective demand. 

Recall that in Tables 10a-10c, we identified the priority demand destinations for the priority food items namely, rice, corn and fish.  We implement Figure 5 for rice as a food security crop.  We first list down the five priority destinations for rice as a food security item:

1. Negros Occidental
2. Camarines Sur
3. Pangasinan
4. Leyte
5. Iloilo

For each province, we assemble the data on current supply, potential supply and demand.  Actually, we need to do this for each and every province in the country.  In the analysis, we only need to arrange the provinces according to their proximity to the priority demand destination.

Example:  Negros Occidental

In this example, the provinces are arranged according to their distance from Bacolod, the capital town of Negros Occidental.  The distance measures are given in column B.  Total supply of rice is given in column C, computed from production data from the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics, assuming a milling recovery ratio of 65%.   Total demand for rice is given in column D, computed as the total demand for rice of the poor and nonpoor, including a buffer of 15%, assuming a unit price of Php 20 per kilo.   Column E is simply the difference between columns C and D.  Column F is computed as a flow:  net flow (i) = \[supply less demand](i) + net flow (i-1).  Note that the index i follows the sequence of the provinces in A.  Initially, let us consider the cells shaded in light blue.

Table 11a.  Net Supply Flow Analysis of Rice for Negros Occidental (‘000 metric tons)

Province |	Distance from Bacolod	| Total supply of rice 	| Total demand for rice with buffer |	Supply less Demand |	Actual Flow of Net Supply
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |  -------- | -------- |   
 A |	B	| C 	| D 	| E	| F 
 Negros Occidental | 	0	| 211.67 |	330.75 |	-119.08 |	-119.08
 Iloilo |	132	| 478.48 |	258.40 |	220.08 |	100.99

Note that the supply shortfall of Negros Occidental is easily solved by promoting rice trade with Iloilo.  This “project” should also be complemented by increasing rice productivity in Negros Occidental and Iloilo.  However, the analysis is very incomplete since we are interested in servicing the entire country.  We need to continue the net supply flow analysis, exhausting all the provinces.

Table 11b.  Net Supply Flow Analysis of Rice using Negros Occidental as Starting Point (‘000 metric tons)

Province |	Distance from Bacolod	| Total supply of rice 	| Total demand for rice with buffer |	Supply less Demand |	Actual Flow of Net Supply
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |  -------- | -------- |   
 A |	B	| C 	| D 	| E	| F 
 Negros Occidental | 	0	| 211.67 |	330.75 |	-119.08 |	-119.08
 Iloilo |	132	| 478.48 |	258.40 |	220.08 |	100.99

Considering the above table in its entirety (not just the rows that are shaded in blue), we observe that, at the national level, there is an expected shortage of rice worth about Php 7 billion.  In the next table, we consider the case where each province is able to produce rice at its potential (maximum yield realized over the years 1990-2002).  We perform the net supply flow analysis given this.

Table 11c.  Net Flow Analysis of Potential Supply of Rice using Negros Occidental as Starting Point (‘000 metric tons)

Province |	Distance from Bacolod	| Total supply of rice 	| Total demand for rice with buffer |	Supply less Demand |	Actual Flow of Net Supply
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |  -------- | -------- |   
 A |	B	| C 	| D 	| E	| F 
 Negros Occidental | 	0	| 211.67 |	330.75 |	-119.08 |	-119.08
 Iloilo |	132	| 478.48 |	258.40 |	220.08 |	100.99

Potential supply is computed as the maximum yield realized by the province over the period 1990-2002 multiplied by the area, recorded in 2002 by the BAS.  We added a column on “yield gap indicator” to identify the provinces for which there is potential additional produce.

Note that, on the whole, we expect a surplus of supply over demand.  However, the distribution problem is bound to be a bit complicated.  In the last column, we shade the entries corresponding to the provinces where there will be transient shortage.  Those shaded in blue are among the 20 priority provinces for this food security item.  Supply in the province is expected to fall short of total demand and this will worsen the food insecurity of the poor.  These provinces should be prioritized in the distribution scheme.  For Davao del Sur, there should also be intervention to encourage increases in productivity. Those shaded in purple are also among the 20 priority provinces for rice as a food security item.  The good news, though, is that the demand can be met by the potential supply in the province.  The challenge, however, is to trade the surplus to the other provinces without unduly increasing the price that could hurt the poor in the “sending” province.  

The next step is to prioritize production areas or the provinces where we can still increase production.  We suggest using two parameters for prioritization – from lowest to highest yield gap, from highest to lowest additional output.  We can define rules to further limit the selection.  In the table below, we have taken out the provinces that are already producing according to potential (that is, the maximum yield was achieved in 2002).  We then sort the remaining provinces according to the lowest to highest yield gap.

Table 11d.  Priority Production Areas – Iteration 1

PROVINCE |	PRODUCTION  in 2002       (‘000 MT) |	AREA HARVESTED in 2002 (Ha)	| YIELD/ HECTARE  in 2002 (MT) |	Max over period  1990-2002 |	Yield gap |	Additional Produce  ('000 MT)
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |  -------- | -------- |  -------- | -------- |   
PANGASINAN |	|73.82	| 215,472.00 |	3.43 |	3.43 |	0.00322 |	0.69 |
RIZAL	|30.87	|8,419.00	|3.67	| 3.68 |	0.0084 |	0.07
APAYAO|	59.84	|20,373.00	|2.94|	2.95 |	0.01362 |	0.28
QUEZON	|138.33	|53,506.00	|2.59	| 2.61|	0.02034 |	1.09
ISABELA	|954.59|	234,240.00|	4.08 |	4.1 |	0.021	|4.92
KALINGA|	123.94|	30,508.00|	4.06 |	4.08 |	0.0216 |	0.66
GUIMARAS|	40.81|	16,961.00	|2.41	| 2.44	| 0.03664 |	0.62
DAVAO DEL SUR|	120.36	|27,177.00|	4.43|	4.47 |	0.03679	|1.00
ILOCOS NORTE|	226.10	|62,585.00|	3.61|	3.65 |	0.04228 |	2.65
QUIRINO |	53.45|	16,011.00	|3.34	|3.38 |	0.04283	| 0.69


Suppose we cluster the provinces according to yield gap:

| Cluster | Yield Gap | Cluster | Yield Gap
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| Cluster 1 |	Yield gap < 0.1 | Cluster 6: |	0.5 ≤	Yield gap < 0.6 |
| Cluster 2 |	0.1 ≤	Yield gap < 0.2 | Cluster 7: |	0.6 ≤	Yield gap < 0.7 |
| Cluster 3 | 	0.2 ≤	Yield gap < 0.3 | Cluster 8: |	0.7 ≤	Yield gap < 0.8 |
| Cluster 4 | 	0.3 ≤	Yield gap < 0.4 | Cluster 9: |	0.8 ≤	Yield gap < 0.9 |
| Cluster 5 | 	0.4 ≤	Yield gap < 0.5 | Cluster 10: |	0.9 ≤	Yield gap < 1.0 |

Within each cluster, we sort the provinces from highest to lowest additional produce.  Following is the table:

Table 11e.  Priority Production Areas – Iteration 2

We can also adopt a finer rule where among the provinces in Cluster 1, we only consider those that can produce an additional of at least 1,000 MT of palay; among those in Cluster 2, we only consider those that can produce an additional of at least 2,000 MT of palay, and so on.  In the table below, we shade the priority provinces according to this finer rule:

Table 11f.  Priority Production Areas – Iteration 3

We may also decide to be more strategic and prioritize provinces with ports or nestled within a road network.  Another option is to identify priority provinces for each region, provided they satisfy our first layers of decision rules. 

Equally important, we need to know the provinces that are the most food insecure.  These are the provinces with a very thin “paying” market (very low demand from the nonpoor in the province) and are very distant from the nearest surplus province.  Given that the rice trading with these provinces is highly unlikely, they should be prioritized in government-sponsored rice distribution program.  Using our sample data, following is that list:

Table 12.  List of Most Rice Insecure Provinces

### Identify the interventions

Our typology of farmers and farmers’ market results in 8 classes.  This is based on the cross-classification of the commodity choices of the farmer–whether he has limited or flexible commodity choices; trade possibility – likely or highly unlikely; and the market for the food item– staple food of the poor or non-staple food.  It is possible to identify the priority interventions for each class.  We present this in the table below:

Table 13.  Objectives of Intervention for each Type of Market

For farms located in areas where trade is highly unlikely, the priority interventions should reduce transportation and production costs.  Actually, production cost may also decrease as a result of reduced transportation cost.  The projects that should be in place are farm-to-market roads, transport facilities, even (cooperative) trading arrangements.  In effect, we want to improve the status of these areas so that trade becomes highly likely.  

Farm-to-market roads do not necessarily mean that the roads should connect the farms to end-markets.  The roads should just connect to a link along the chain.  Of course, if it can link to a network, so much the better.  Recall our proposition that perhaps it is easier to link the poor in the agriculture sector with the nonpoor in the agriculture sector.

If there is a quality difference in the produce of remote farms, then a higher price may be justified.  For this, there is a need for grading and product standardization. 

Farms that produce the staple food of the poor should be encouraged to increase production and reduce volatility.  R&D to shorten the gestation of crops and enable more frequent planting is important, but without exhausting the limits of the soil.  Note that irrigation systems also serve the former purpose.  Adequate postharvest and storage facilities need to be in place, and so should technologies that extend the shelf-life of the food item, including packaging technologies.  If these are produced in farms with flexible crop choices, a more efficient objective is to encourage more producers and/or traders.  This will also result in lower consumer prices.   

Farms that have limited commodity choices should have a diversified market which can even extend to the rest of the world.  Also needed are technologies to develop by-products and create effective demand for the item.  Farmers may also want some form of product standardization and grading to help them gain a market niche.  But this step is bound to increase trading cost and may discourage some producers, in which case, this is recommended only for non-staple food items.  

In farms that produce non-staples and have flexible commodity choices, the need is to facilitate the flow of market information.  The information needed also conforms to the seed-to-shelf flow – information on production technologies, processing and packaging, transport and trading, market preferences, and pricing trends.  At the very least, this means that there may be additional items that should be monitored by the BAS and NSO.  

Crops used as intermediate products will be classified according to the demand for the final good for which it is being used as input.  Most probably, the farms that produce these are already linked to the other production sectors or sub-sectors.  If these are produces in farms with limited crop choices, the objective is to ensure that there are many different final producers that will demand their product.
	
In Table 13, we identified the objective specific to each type of food item (as categorized from the farmers’ side and as categorized from the farmers’ market’s side) and the type of farm classified according to trade possibilities.  In Table 14, we replicate the same table with additional columns that indicate the sub-MFOs that correspond to each objective.  Note that the list is indicative and should be finalized after thorough research, consultation and validation processes

Table 14.  Suggested Sub-MFOs for each “Market-type”

Note that sub-MFO 10 should be undertaken for the entire sector.

We can revise the table above to correspond to the interventions listed in the 5 Pillars of Agricultural Development.

### Using Results of the Simple Trend Analysis

The simple trend analysis earlier discussed can also provide information on the broad class of interventions needed by a region or province (depending on available data) and specific to a commodity.  The historical data is the “business as usual” scenario, and forecasting this demonstrates what will be the performance if things remain as they were – private investment and production decisions, public investment and production decisions, etc.  Consider the following possible graphs of a time series on production:

![figure 1 ch7](statics/figure_1_ch7.png)

The forecast is an increasing trend in production, even under the “business as usual” scenario.  There is no need for production support.  However, there is a need to look into the post-production support – postharvest, storage, marketing and distribution.  It is important that the region (or province) be able to export the surplus production in order not to dampen prices and adversely affect farmers’ incomes (profits).  If the commodity is not a priority good, perhaps because it does not constitute a significant portion of the budget of the poor, the R&D should concentrate on value-adding and shelf-life prolonging technology.

![figure 2 ch7](statics/figure_2_ch7.png)

The forecast mimics the volatility observed in the historical trend.  If this concerns a priority commodity, the intervention should focus on smoothing out the “kinks”.  An example would be an irrigation system and planting technologies that shorten the gestation.  If this is not a priority commodity, one possibility is that the trend simply follows market forces, in particular, it responds to changing preferences.  The study should look into the behavior of the farmers concerned, especially if they are able to shift to other crops right away.  Their need is to have ready access to updated market information.

![figure 3-4 ch7](statics/figure_3_4_ch7.png)

If the forecast is a declining trend or even a “straight line” trend (meaning that per capita production is declining), then the intervention calls for production support, but only if it concerns a priority commodity.  If area planted has not been decreasing, then it is the yield per unit hectare that is decreasing.  One possibility is the deterioration in the quality of planting materials.  If it does not concern a priority commodity, the study should determine if the observed trend simply follows demand preferences.  We should also be able to observe diversification of crop choices and/or income sources in the farmers.  The need is to facilitate this diversification as well as ready access to updated information.  Note that if this concerns a perennial crop, the intervention should create effective demand – R&D to look at other uses of the commodity, re-packaging or new processing technologies.
