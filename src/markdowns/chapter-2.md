## Chapter 2 Review of Planning and Investment Programming Practices and Methods

There are a number of methodologies that can be used for either planning or investment programming, or both .  Some of the more popular ones are the following:      
      
- [WWHw](#wwhw) 
- [SWOT analysis](#swot)
- [TOWS analysis](#tows)
- [Logframe analysis](#logframe)
- [GAMs](#gams)
    - ["Expert" opinion](#expert)
    - [Delphi technique](#delphi)
- [NEDA Screening and prioritization criteria](#neda)
- [MFOs](#mfos)      

### <a name="wwhw"></a>WWHw

WWHw  is a framework for conducting planning and investment programming.  The procedure is guided by three broad questions:

1. Where are we now?
2. Where do we want to go?
3. How do we get to Where we want to go?

When this framework is used for planning and investment programming, one realizes that it is just a generic tool that has to be complemented by other tools, specific to each broad question.  The SWOT and TOWS can be adopted as tools to organize the discussion on question 1.  Question 2 is essentially a visioning exercise; it can be a consensus of different stakeholders.  Question 3, meanwhile, is a restatement of the problem of investment programming.  We may also re-arrange the questions so that Question 2 comes before 1.  This way, the goal and consequently, the targets are stable.

### <a name="swot"></a>SWOT Analysis
SWOT stands for Strengths – Weakness – Opportunities – Threats.  It is a generic framework used for environmental scanning, commonly known as situational analysis.  It groups factors into internal and external, then further into positive and negative.  The internal factors are strengths (+) and weaknesses (-); the external factors are opportunities (+) and threats (-).

Because SWOT appears fairly easy, it has become the most commonly used and often misused tool.  It has been used in planning, investment programming and some even go so far as applying it to evaluation.  There are two requisites of SWOT analysis that are often overlooked, hence the misuse:

One is that the SWOT should be undertaken in relation to a goal or a desired outcome.  Thus the proper phrasing of the questions should be:  (1a) What are the organization’s strengths that can be used to attain this desired outcome?  (2a) What are the organization’s weaknesses that constrain the attainment of this desired outcome?  And so on…, instead of the general questions: (1b)  What are the organization’s strengths?  (2b)  What are the organization’s weaknesses?

Two is that the answers to the SWOT questions should pertain to a medium to long term forecast horizon, not just the present scenario.      

### <a name="tows"></a>TOWS Analysis

The “other side” of the SWOT analysis is the TOWS analysis.  The meaning of each letter in the TOWS corresponds to that in the SWOT.  Apart from the reverse order of the name is the shift in orientation.  The recommended sequence is to first scan the external factors, looking at the negatives (Threats) and the positives (Opportunities).  The strategy to address the threats and respond to the opportunities can be formulated upon examination of the internal factors, the negatives (weaknesses) that need to be remedied and the positives (strengths) that need to be fully exploited.

Like the SWOT analysis, the TOWS is simply an environmental scanning tool.  For use in planning and investment programming, it needs to be complemented with other tools to correspond to the other needed procedures.

### <a name="logframe"></a>Logframe Analysis

The logframe is another versatile tool that can be used for planning, investment programming and project evaluation.  In fact, the logframe is the recommended procedure for developing the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan.

Logframe analysis is based on the following management perspectives:

a. It is results-oriented.
b. It employs the basic scientific method in analysis.
c. It adopts a systems approach.
d. It serves as a contract between and among the implementers and the intended beneficiaries.

The logframe models the program in matrix form

a.	clearly specifying the goal of the sector to which the project belongs,
b.	the expected impact of the project that will contribute to meeting this goal,
c.	the project’s outputs that will result in the expected impact, and 
d.	the project’s inputs that are needed to produce the output.
e.	Important assumptions are stated, and
f.	a list of verifiable indicators of success is given,
g.	together with the proposed strategy to measure accomplishment.

| Narrative Summary | Objectively Verifiable Indicators | Means of Verification | Key Assumptions and Risks |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Sector Goal |
| Purpose | 
| Outputs | 
| Activities |

##### 1.1 Core Concept – CAUSE and EFFECT

These are the “necessary conditions” line of reasoning.  Broadly, this concept says that if the CAUSE is present, then the result is the EFFECT.  Corresponding to the components (working our way up the rows of column 1), we mean:

a.	If INPUTS then OUTPUTs.  That is, the INPUTS are necessary conditions to produce the OUTPUTS.
b.	If OUTPUTS then OUTCOMES.  That is, the OUTPUTS are necessary conditions to produce the OUTCOMES.
c.	If OUTCOMES then IMPACT.  That is, the OUTCOMES are necessary conditions to produce the IMPACT.
      

##### 1.2	Corollary Concept – sufficient conditions

The line of reasoning above is incomplete without the sufficient conditions.  These are the assumptions that, if met, will provide the enabling conditions.  Roughly we say,

a.	If INPUTS and ASSUMPTIONS 1, then OUTPUTS.
b.	If OUTPUTS and ASSUMPTIONS 2, then OUTCOMES.
c.	If OUTCOMES and ASSUMPTIONS 3, then IMPACT.
      

### <a name="gams"></a>GAMs

With respect to planning and investment programming, GAMs stands for Goals Achievement Matrix.  As the name implies, the result of GAMs is presented as a matrix.    Actually, there are two kinds of matrices – the first we will call the scorer’s matrix which is filled out by each scorer individually, and the second is the summary matrix.

The scorer’s matrix may look something like this, assuming that there are four projects being scored on the basis of three criteria:

Name of Scorer: _________________________ 

| Criterion | Weight | Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Criteria 1 | W1 |
| Criteria 2 | W2 |
| Criteria 3 | W3 |
| Criteria 4 | W4 |
| Total Score | 100% |

After collecting all the scorers’ matrices, the results are summarized as in the following summary matrix:

| Proposed Project | Scorer 1 | Scorer 2 | Scorer ... | Scorer n | Total Score | Rank |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- | ----------- |
| Project 1 |
| Project 2 |
| Project ... |
| Project n |


##### Steps preliminary to GAMs

At first glance, it may seem that GAMs is the tool that we can use to guide the discussion of question 3 of the WWHw framework.  Upon closer look, however, we realize that there are several procedures that need to be undertaken preliminary to GAMs:

- Identification of scorers.

- Setting the criteria for evaluation.

- Determining the weights of each criterion.

- Enumeration of projects to be evaluated.

In GAMs, the criteria used are the very goals identified for the sector.  In a way, it takes off from the answers to question 2 of WWHw.

#### <a name="expert"></a>Expert’s opinion
    
The results of the GAMs depend heavily on the composition of experts.  It is important that the experts be of good repute, devoid of any interest in any one of the projects being evaluated or in any corollary project that may be affected by any one of the projects.  The pool of experts should also represent a good mix, a balance if possible, of the many stakeholders in the sector.  Pertaining to agriculture, these are the farmers (small, medium, large-scale), fisherfolk (aquatic, municipal, marine), agriprocessing, traders, input suppliers, R&D experts, etc.  If possible, there should be a good representation from the major commodity producers.  In addition to this list, market-oriented investment programming requires that even the consumer groups are represented as well.

#### <a name="delphi"></a> Delphi technique

It is possible to arrive at a consensus using the Delphi technique.  This technique was first used in the 1950s to arrive at consensus forecasts.  It is an iterative process where at every step, each expert is advised of the opinions of the other experts including the reasons behind their answers, and the frequency of occurrence.  Each expert is given the chance to revise his opinion.  The iteration is repeated until a consensus is reached.

In relation to GAMs, the Delphi technique can be used to set the criteria and the weights of each criterion for the screening and prioritization of projects.  Remember that the goals are already known at this point.  Following are the steps involved:

1.	Experts are called in to assign weights to each of the goals.

2.	Descriptive statistics of the weights are then computed – minimum, maximum and average values.

3.	These are presented to the same experts who are then asked to express opinion for or against the use of the average as the weight for that specific criterion.

4.	Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a consensus is reached.
      

### <a name="neda"></a>NEDA Screening and Prioritization Criteria

NEDA, usually in collaboration with the DBM, issues guidelines on the screening and prioritization of projects.

Screening is done by evaluating the responsiveness of the project to the desired societal outcomes and appropriateness for government, especially national government to undertake the project.  If the answer to any of these is a NO, the project is screened out.

The next step begins the scoring.  There are two broad categories of evaluation: need/effectiveness and sensitivity to the identified priority sector activities.

### <a name="mfos"></a>Major Final Outputs

A major modification in planning procedure that is being introduced lately is the focus on major final outputs (MFOs) rather than on priority sector activities (PSAs).  This is actually a major enhancement – outputs rather than activities.  It raises the bar of accountability a bit higher.  Output produces physical evidence that can easily be monitored and even evaluated, unlike activities.

The initial list of sub-MFOs of the Department of Agriculture is the following:

1. Production support services (physical, equipment and biotechnological support to production)
2. Market development services (market promotion and linkages assistance)
3. Credit facilitation services (facilitation of access to credit)
4. Irrigation development services (construction or rehab of all kinds of irrigation systems including watershed and service roads)
5. Other infrastructure and post-harvest facilities (construction or rehab of infra, e.g., FMR and fish port; distribution of PH equipment)
6. Extension support, education and training services (transfer of knowledge and  skills)
7. Research and Development services (conduct of projects or studies; and construction or rehab of research stations)
8. Comprehensive regulatory services (issuance and enforcement of rules and regulation, standards and similar fiat)
9. National Information Network (production and dissemination of info packages)
10. Policy, planning and advocacy services (formulation, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of policies, programs and projects)
      
### DA’s Five Pillars of Agricultural Development

DA’s present framework of agricultural development goes beyond increasing production or productivity.  It is focused on increasing profitability of stakeholders, both producers and consumers.  Interventions are categorized into the five pillars: (1) infrastructure like irrigation and road network, (2) technology and extension, (3) rural credit, (4) postharvest and storage and (5) market access.

> Some Remarks
Note that all of the procedures discussed above assume that there is already a listing of projects.  None of them discusses how to answer question 3 of the WWHw, which is really the essence of investment programming.  A technique that has been espoused is the use of models, actually estimates of the production function.  Recall that these models describe how capital and labor mix to produce output.  This strategy, however, is easier said than done.  Besides, the coefficients are bound to be the average between the best and worst performances.  This will not provide much guidance if we are to identify catalysts.
A market orientation provides a framework for investment programming.  This will be discussed in the next chapters.
