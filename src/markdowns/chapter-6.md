## Chapter 6 Know your market

This phase is the essence of market-oriented investment programming.  It is about knowing the market.  To the private sector, the market is really the segment of potential buyers of their product.  But to the public investment program analyst, both consumers and producers are important.  In the private sector, this step is also about knowing the competition.  To the public investment program analyst, it is about ensuring that there is healthy competition among many sellers.

In order to emphasize the difference between public and private sector roles, we reiterate the objectives of public investment programming for the agriculture sector:
- promote efficiency of agricultural marketing systems, 
- promote equity among the different stakeholders in the agriculture sector (producers, consumers, traders, etc.), 
- promote stability in the supply and demand of agricultural commodities (especially food) and 
- represent the country’s agricultural sector in the international community

The major technique to use is “market segmentation.”  On the side of the consumers, we need to distinguish between the poor and nonpoor, and for each group, the agriculture and non-agricultural sectors.  The poor in the non-agriculture sector needs to have access to cheap food.  In contrast, the poor in the agriculture sector needs to be able to sell their produce at good prices.  They also need access to cheap nonfood items.  The nonpoor in the agriculture sector is probably linked to the nonpoor in the non-agriculture sector.

The public investment analyst must promote efficiency in each of these markets.  Now, it is easier to link the poor in the agriculture sector to the nonpoor in the agriculture sector than to the nonpoor in the non-agriculture sector.  And perhaps it is also easier to link the poor in the non-agriculture sector with the nonpoor in the non-agriculture sector.

We discuss this further by breaking it down to two parts – first, know the “farmers’ market”; and second, know the “farmers”.

### Know your “Farmers’ Market”

We are interested in the size of the market and their preferences.  It is better to structure the analysis with a geographic focus – immediate vicinity (within municipality/province), within the region, within the country, rest of the world.  For each geographic segment, we need to know the size of the market – total spending for every major food group, total spending of the agriculture and non-agriculture sector, then the poor and nonpoor in each sector.  We also need to identify the staple food of the poor. This is the food item that constitutes a big share of the food budget of the poor, particularly those in the non-agricultural sector.  Another useful indicator is to take the ratio of the share of the food item in the food budget of the poor to the share in the food budget of the nonpoor. A ratio greater than 1 means that the food item is more important to the poor than to the nonpoor.

We also need to characterize the usual preferences of each geographic segment.  The preferences can be described in a number of ways but we can start with the basic qualifiers:

  - Cereals – 
 - grains vs. bread vs. noodles, etc.
 - rice – ordinary vs. special, NFA, etc.
  - Meat products 
 - beef vs. pork vs. chicken
 - Raw vs. processed meat vs. canned meat
  - Fish – fresh vs. processed vs. canned fish products
  - Fruits – fresh vs. fruit preparation
  - Vegetables – leafy vegs. Vs. fruit vegs, etc.

Proportion of food eaten outside the home

The Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) is a good source of information but we need to obtain the detailed database, the one called version 3.  The detailed description of the FIES is given in the Technical Annex.

There are other sources of information – the Food Consumption Survey conducted by the FNRI, local knowledge from owners of supermarket chains, restaurant chains and wet market.  

What this also implies is that we need to undertake the analysis at disaggregated levels.  We now illustrate this step using data at the national level.

Following is the share in the food budget of major food groups, at the national level:

Table 4.  Budget Share of Major Food Groups, National Average

| Food Group | Amount in Million Pesos | Share in Food Budget (%) |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------|
| Cereals | 225,834.80  | 25.71 |
| Fruits and Vegetables| 87,272.17 |  9.94 | 
| Meat|  137,226.96 | 15.63 |
| Fish and Marine Products| 112,142.38  | 12.77 | 
| Dairy and Eggs | 65,582.41 | 7.47 | 
| Non-alcoholic Beverages| 50,420.49 |  5.74 | 
| Others |  199,749.81 |  22.74 | 

We now divide the market into two segments – the bottom 30% and the upper 70% and compute the same figures.  A more relevant segmentation is “poor” vs. “nonpoor.”  However, there can be considerable time lag before official poverty thresholds are finalized and disseminated.  These thresholds are needed to distinguish between the poor and nonpoor.  An alternative is to adopt the concept of relative poverty, usually expressed as some percentile of the income distribution.  In 2003, the official poverty incidence is 30.4%.  What this is means is that the bottom 30.4% of the population in terms of per capita income constitute the poor.  Thus the cutoff 30/70 presents quite a close approximation of the poor/nonpoor categorization.  Needless to say, the cutoff can be revised as new data become available.

Table 5.  Budget Share of Major Food Groups according to Income Class

| Food Group | Bottom 30% Amount | Bottom 30% Food Share | Upper 70% Amount | Upper 70% Food Share | 
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------| ---------- | ---------| 
| Cereals |	64,619.36 | 41.04 | 147,934.55 | 20.52 |
| Fruits and Vegetables	| 15,963.43 | 10.14 | 71,308.74 | 9.89 | 
| Meat | 13,730.72 | 8.72 | 123,496.24 | 17.13 | 
| Fish and Marine Products | 24,836.30 | 15.77 | 87,306.07 | 12.11 | 
| Dairy and Eggs | 7,965.49 | 5.06 | 57,616.92 | 7.99 | 
| Non-alcoholic Beverages	| 7,304.00 | 4.64 | 43,116.48 | 5.98 | 
| Others | 23,042.47 | 14.63 | 189,988.24 | 26.36 |

The table above reveals the differences in the diet patterns of the two market segments.  Cereals still form a major part of the diet of both segments, but even more so among the bottom 30%.  Meat is a major chunk of the food budget of the upper 70%.  We also note that the diet of the upper 70% is more diverse, hence the significant “others”.

We should design government intervention according to the need of the consumer, and always balancing the efficiency and equity objectives.  The need of the poor is to have access to affordable food with reasonable quality.  The nonpoor, especially those in the upper 10% of the income distribution, meanwhile, are willing to pay a premium for high quality.  If government tries to come up with high quality but inexpensive food, then there will be substantial leakage.  

If we are considering consumer subsidy, the obvious candidate is the cereals group.  Note, however, that it is also considered an important part of the diet of the upper 70%.  In order to minimize leakage, we need to consider quality differences without compromising food safety.  Meat is definitely a nonpoor’s diet and should not be the object of any consumer subsidy.  In fact, a good strategy is to encourage cereal producers to engage in livestock production while improving productivity in cereal production.  This way, cereal prices are kept low but farmers’ incomes are augmented by livestock sales.
 
For our purposes, we need more details than the above tables give us.  Following is the detailed food expenditure table of the bottom 30%:

The above table also informs us of food items primarily sourced from own production.  To stretch it a bit, this may be the extent of subsistence farming.  We see this prevalent in some root crops – cassava, camote, and gabi.  For this group, we need to know what constrains them from participating in the market.  Interestingly, most of the poor are net buyers of rice.

We are now ready to identify the major staple food of the poor.  We use two parameters – (1) the share of the item in the food budget and (2) the ratio of the share in the poor’s food budget to the share in the nonpoor’s food budget of the same food item.  We prioritize those that comprise a big share of the food budget of the poor, then those with ratios greater than 1.  We now arrive at the following grouping of food items:

The priority groupings suggested above can be modified.  As it is, we include in priority 1 those that constitute at least 20% of the food budget of the poor and is considered more important by the poor than by the nonpoor, as reflected in ratios greater than 1.  In priority 2, the food item comprises between 10 to 20% of the food budget of the poor and also has ratios greater than 1.  Note that if the ratio is less than 1, meaning that the food is considered more important by the nonpoor than by the poor, then we should introduce quality differentiation where the “inferior” quality gets the subsidy.  This should not come at the expense of health and safety, though.  In the case of rice, this may correspond to 30% broken vs. 5% broken; or some labeling stamp coming from PhilRice that it is certified “premium quality rice”, etc.

By far the most important food item in the poor’s budget is rice, followed by fresh fish, then corn.  For corn, there is no need to come up with different varieties because leakage is bound to be very minimal.  Corn producers, however, should have product diversification to allow them to tap that segment of the market with buying power.  In fact, we can exploit the fact that corn is being used as intermediate product for poultry and livestock.  For rice and fresh fish, there should be varieties to cater to the different market segments.  

Given the significance of rice in the poor’s budget, it should be considered a national government concern.  For sure, the solution will transcend political and administrative jurisdictions, even beyond the region.  Productivity, especially in ordinary rice, should be increased.  This should be accompanied by adequate postharvest, and even storage facilities.  Diversification away from rice is an option in areas that are inefficient producers of rice, by virtue of geography, topography or other factors that cannot be effectively controlled.  Of course, this presupposes that there can be other more efficient use of these lands.

Those in priority 3 comprise between 2-3% of the poor’s budget but is considered more important by the poor than by the nonpoor.  Quality differentiation is not much needed, except possibly for the fruit vegetables.

Those in priority 4 comprise between 2 to 4% of the poor’s budget but is considered more important by the nonpoor than by the poor.  Quality differentiation is required.  In fact, the same producer can produce the commodity but with obvious intent at product segregation.  This way, the producer can tap diverse markets.

Those in priorities 5 and 6 constitute a small percentage of the poor’s budget, but are considered more important by the poor than by the nonpoor.  Group 2 is another case.  As with corn producers, producers of these items should have a wide product diversification. 

Those in groups 1 and 3 are obviously non-food security items.  The market for these items is the nonpoor.  Since the nonpoor obviously has capacity to pay, we should simply let market forces determine the price.  What government needs to provide is enabling conditions for the market to really work – tag price, proper labeling and certification as to claim of quality (organic, fortified, etc.);  and measures to enforce health and safety standards.

The above protocol can be implemented at the regional and even provincial level.  This will result in a more detailed understanding of the market and the crafting of a more effective strategy to meet the market’s demands.

We should also be conscious of agricultural products that serve as intermediate inputs in the production of other food items, say corn as feeds for livestock and poultry, and even industrial crops.  A useful reference is the Input-Output (IO) Accounts being produced by the NSCB, consisting of the inter-industry and inter-commodity accounts.  The inter-industry account is represented as a matrix (as with other accounts); the columns represent industry users (broadly classified into eleven sectors); the rows represent the “suppliers” of inputs used by the industry.  Inputs are classified into intermediate and primary inputs.  The intermediate inputs are physical goods and services produced by domestic industry and consumed also by domestic industry.  Primary inputs represent labor, land, and imported factors of production that are being utilized by domestic industry.  The inter-commodity account is interpreted in the same way as the inter-industry account except that the interest is on the production of the commodity itself.  For instance, in the production of palay, how much palay is needed; how much agricultural services, how much fuel, etc. is needed.  Again, the primary inputs used are included.

### Know your farmers

Recall that we are using the term “farmers” quite liberally to include even the fishermen, livestock and poultry raisers and the other factors of production in agriculture like land, equipment, etc.  Following are some of the indicators we are interested in.  Note that the list has been arranged according to the factor of production being described.

LAND
•	Area (total)
•	Area per farm
•	Distribution
•	Location
•	Topography 
•	Soil type

The Census of Agriculture and Fisheries is the most comprehensive source of information on the “farmers.”  This is discussed in the Technical Annex.  Being a census, however, the data is quite voluminous and it is suggested that the analysis be done by province.  The National Statistics Office also produces analysis tables by province.  In the Annex, we include the following tables:
Table 1 – Number and Size of Farms
What the CA lacks, however, is information on topography and soil type.  This information is being compiled in a GIS by the Bureau of Soils and Water Management.  

LABOR
•	Number of agriculture-related workers (total and by class of worker)
•	Age
•	Gender
•	Highest educational attainment
•	Primary occupation

The CA collects these information with respect to farm operators.  If the interest concerns all workers in the agriculture sector, the best reference is the Labor Force Survey.  This is collected by the NSO on a quarterly basis.  It is meant to provide estimates at the regional level.

CAPITAL
•	Irrigation System
•	Equipment and machineries
•	Postharvest facilities
•	Farm to market roads
•	Storage facilities
•	Transport
•	Market centers and trading posts

The CA collects information on irrigation system and equipment and machineries that a farm holding utilizes.  Table 4 on Main Irrigation Type Used per province is given in the Annex.  Data on the other capital has to be especially obtained since these are not available at the farm level and therefore would not be included in the CA.  The data collection instrument already developed by the DA-PIPD can be used to obtain and/or update this information.  These tables are given in the Annex.

PRODUCTION PROCESS
•	Crops planted – temporary vs. permanent crops
•	Monocropping/multi-cropping/inter-cropping
•	Organic vs. non-organic farming

Tables 2 and 3 of the CA give the Top 5 Temporary and Permanent Crops Grown, respectively in each province.  The practice of mono/multi/inter-cropping can also be especially processed from the CA.  In the 1991 CA, information is also obtained on the practice of organic vs. non-organic farming, unfortunately, this is no longer available in the 2002 CA.  

MARKETING ARRANGEMENT at first point of sale 
•	Type and form of product sold
•	Trend in farmgate prices
The BAS collects this data quarterly.  This can be analyzed alongside the consumer price data of the NSO, then we can determine the difference between farmgate and market price to estimate the transaction costs.

We also need to identify the farms with inflexible commodity choices.  To do this, we need to tabulate the area devoted to a particular commodity.  Of interest to us are the permanent crops and those commodities for which there is substantial sunk investment, like rice paddies within the service area of a national irrigation system and communal irrigation system, shelter constructed for livestock.  There may also be areas which for reasons of topography or soil type can be planted to only one or two types of crops.  For these farms, they are not able to easily shift their cropping patterns, should they want to respond to changing market preferences.

It is also good to measure the extent of market orientation of the farmers.  Suppose we classify the crop farmers according to major crop planted.  The following table is taken from Edillon (2005) and shows the price elasticity matrix of the supply of major crops.

Table. 8. Price Elasticity of the Supply of Major Crops

![table 8](statics/table_8.png)

The diagonal entries (shown in yellow) correspond to the own-price supply elasticities and are expected to be positive.  Recall that the supply curve is upward sloping since quantity supplied is expected to increase in response to an increase in price.  A higher elasticity implies that the supply is very responsive to price changes, an indication that the “farmers” are market-oriented.  This would be the case for peanut, cassava and cacao.  Other crops and banana are not very responsive, but still more responsive than palay and corn.  Meanwhile, pineapple and sugar can be considered non-responsive to price changes.  This is understandable given the long gestation between the planting and harvesting and the practice of rattooning; all of which constrains the farmer from responding to price changes immediately.  

If the profile of farms is very heterogenous, we may want to conduct municipal level analysis as well.  We illustrate this step using data on Misamis Occidental.

Farms in Misamis Occidental average 1.74 hectares.  In terms of temporary crops, it is mostly planted to corn (60%) and rice (21%).  Next in significance are rootcrops – camote (8%), cassava (5%) and gabi (2%).  There are other temporary crops planted but these occupy less than 1% of farmlands in the province.  The table below shows the area planted to each crop, but considering only the first cropping.

The average age of farmers in Misamis Occidental is 47 years.  The chart below illustrates the age distribution where it becomes obvious that a number of farmers belong to the “65 and over” age group.  This group represents almost the same proportion as the group “40-44” years of age.
