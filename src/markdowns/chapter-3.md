## Chapter 3 Discussion of Basic Concepts

Before we can come up with an effective public investment program, it is important to understand the motivation that should guide the procedure.  To do that, we need first to understand what investment is, in general; then focus on public investment, in particular.

### Understanding investment, in general
---

Investment has to be understood within the context of the bigger production process.  Thus, we first need to define the production function.  A production function is simply a (mathematical) representation that describes how inputs combine to produce the output of goods and services.  Inputs, or factors of production, are generally classified into three – land, labor, capital.

- Land, or more generally, natural resources.  These are resources that come from mother nature in raw or unprocessed form.
- Labor consists of the human time spent in production, regardless of the skill level.
- Capital are the durable goods that are produced to produce yet other goods.  They are utilized by labor to convert land (or natural resources) into other goods that can be consumed by man.  By definition, capital are intermediate goods (in contrast to final consumption goods).
      
Investment, meanwhile, is defined as the addition to the stock of capital goods in the public or private sector over a given time period.  The general objective of undertaking investment is to increase production of output.  However, we will consider the following specific purposes of investment:

1. to increase production capacity,
2. to improve productivity,
3. to improve quality of produce, and
4. to replace depreciated capital.
      
#### To increase production capacity

One way to increase output produced is by increasing the quantity of all inputs (assuming that the production process follows constant returns to scale).  The strategy in this case is to undertake investment such that the stock of capital increases in proportion to the increases in land and labor inputs.

#### To improve productivity

The second way to increase output produced is by improving the technology by which inputs are utilized to produce output.  In other words, given the same amount of land and/or labor inputs, we invest in durable equipment that will allow us to produce more output.

#### To improve quality of produce
      
Sometimes we define output with a quality dimension.  In other words, we only consider the outputs that meet certain quality standards.  In this case, the objective of the investment may be to increase quality output.

#### To replace depreciated capital

Output produced may not be in the same volume and quality as before because the capital being used is already depreciated.  For one thing, there is the expected wear and tear of capital equipment.  For another, there can be obsolescence due to the introduction of modern technology.

### Typology of Goods and Services
---

There is another concept that needs to be clarified before we define public investment.  This concerns the typology of goods and services.

Goods and services are typically classified as public, private or mixed.  The distinction depends on two characteristics: rivalry in consumption and excludability of benefits.  Consumption is rivalrous if two or more individuals cannot consume the same good at the same time.  Excludability of benefits means that the benefit provided by the good is limited only to those who consume it.  Private goods exhibit these two characteristics, such as food, clothing, etc.

At the other extreme is the public good where consumption is non-rival and benefits are not limited to those who consume it.  An example is public defense.  A good defense system preserves our sovereignty as a nation.  Once provided, all residents consume the “service.”  Moreover, the benefits are enjoyed by all, even by those who did not support the policy nor did not pay their taxes.

An inherent difficulty with public good is pricing.  Recall that the good can be consumed by more than one consumer simultaneously.  One might think that perhaps the “total” price can be divided by the potential number of consumers.  The problem, however, is that individuals will probably disguise their true demand for the good or service when it is yet in the planning stage, especially since there is nothing to stop them from enjoying the benefit of the good once it is provided.  This is called the “free-rider” problem.

In contrast, a private good can be priced since only one individual can consume it at any given time and benefits accrue only to the consumer.  In other words, we can limit the benefits only to consumers and we can limit the consumers to only those who paid for the good.

In between the private good – public good continuum are what we call mixed goods.  A public highway is an example.  There can be more than one vehicle that can use the highway at any time, and this is non-rival up to a point.  However, its benefit is limited to those using the highway.  In fact, we can build toll gates to collect tolls and fences to screen consumers to only those who paid the toll.  But the amount of fees that can be collected need to be weighed against the cost of collecting the fees.  It is also difficult to gauge the potential number of consumers since the number of users is bound to decrease once toll fees are collected.

### Role of the Public Sector
---

Public investment is more than just the provision of public goods.  Rather, it is the investment undertaken by the public sector.  To understand this better, we need to review the functions of government.  These are:
1. improve economic efficiency,
2. make the distribution of income less unequal,
3. stabilize the economy through macroeconomic policies, and
4. represent the country internationally.
      
#### Improve economic efficiency

The market is considered the best arbiter on decisions such as what to produce?, how many?, for whom?, in what way?  However, there may be conditions that hinder the functioning of markets.  Government then steps in to address these conditions.  The provision of public goods generally falls under this function since we cannot expect the market to efficiently provide for these goods.

#### Make the distribution of income less unequal

Every decent society cares that no one should go hungry, without clothing, without education, etc.  This is not to say, though, that government should concentrate on welfare provision.  In more recent times, the guiding principle is for government to equalize opportunities but availment of the needs and wants will still be subject to efforts exerted by individuals and households.

#### Stabilize the economy through macroeconomic policies

Investments are mostly undertaken to meet increased market demand where the latter may increase because of increases in population or income, etc.  No one has perfect information about income growth prospects of the country but there are macroeconomic policies that greatly affect this – interest rate, exchange rate, trade policies, fiscal deficit, to name a few.  Imagine a situation where the forecast is for vibrant income growth, then investments will surely be undertaken (subject to availability of investible funds).  Now, if income did not grow, say because of political turmoil, then the investment will turn out to be nonperforming asset, at best, and nonperforming loans, at worst.

#### Represent the country internationally

Improvements in transport and communication technology have facilitated international mobility of goods and services.  However, this leaves us open to other shocks – plant and animal diseases, economic conditions in other countries (both good and bad), unforeseen trade barriers, etc.  For this reason, there are bodies that regulate international trade and other transactions, e.g., WTO, UN, etc.  Our government represents us in these forum, making sure that our interests are protected (both consumer and investor interests) as best as possible.

### Role of Public Investments
---
To define public investment, we refer to precisely those two terms – public and investment.  As an investment, it is meant to add to the existing stock of capital, the reasons for which could be any of the four purposes listed above.  It will be undertaken by the public sector in order to fulfill any of the four functions of government discussed above.
The rule of thumb is that the “functions of government” provides the finer screen test after the “purposes of investment”.  Suppose, for example, that investment is being proposed to replace old capital stock.  This means that there is a purpose for which the investment is being proposed.  We then need to subject it the 4-way test: (1) Will it improve efficiency? (2) Will it result in less unequal distribution of income and assets? (3) Will it promote macroeconomic stability? (4) Will it promote our cross-border interests?

In general, macroeconomic stability is the concern of NEDA and the Department of Finance.  It is with respect to functions 1, 2 and 4 where there can be conflicting results, especially in the short to medium term.  These conflicts are resolved by invoking basic principles in public investment programming.

### National vs. Local Public Investments
---
Some investments realize economies of scale, that is, the cost of the addition of service area becomes lesser as the coverage becomes bigger.  Take the following example of an irrigation system that costs Php 10 million for a service area of 100 hectares.  The unit cost comes up to Php 100,000 per hectare.  An addition hectare will require Php 5,000 more in irrigation canals, etc.  This brings the unit cost to only Php 99,059.41.  Assuming that the benefits per unit area are not reduced, then we say that the project realizes economies of scale.

There may also be cases when the operation of a project produces undesirable effects to non-beneficiaries.  Or, a major input in the project has multiple uses.  Again, a good example that comes to mind is an irrigation system (gravity type).  The water source definitely belongs to a water system and impounding it at some point will affect the downstream system.  Moreover, it may be used as a source of hydroelectric power, drinking water or water for industrial and residential uses.

The above two examples are the two major justifications for national provision and management of investments – economies of scale and externality effects.  On the other hand, there are projects that suffer from diseconomies of scale and do not produce externality effects or else the impact is limited in geographical scope.  The latter are examples of projects that may qualify for local public provision.

RA 7160 or the Local Government contains specific provisions on agricultural services to be rendered by the LGU.  The following is taken from Chapter 2, section 17 of the Code:

Province
- Agricultural extension and on-site research services and facilities which include the prevention and control of plant and animal pests and diseases; dairy farms, livestock markets, animal breeding stations, and artificial insemination centers; and assistance in the organization of farmers and fisherman’s cooperatives and other collective organizations, as well as the transfer of appropriate technology
- Infrastructure facilities intended to service the need of the residents of the province and which are funded out of provincial funds including, but not limited to, provincial roads and bridges, inter-municipal waterworks, drainage and sewerage, flood control and irrigation systems, reclamation projects and similar facilities
- Investment support services, including access to credit financing

Municipality
- Extension and on-site research services and facilities related to agriculture and fishery activities which include dispersal of livestock and poultry, fingerlings, and other seeding materials for aquaculture; palay, corn and vegetable seed farms; medicinal plant gardens; fruit tree, coconut and other kinds of seedlings nurseries; demonstration farms; quality control of copra and improvement and development of local distribution channels, preferably through cooperatives; interbarangay irrigation systems; water and soil resources utilization and conservation projects; and enforcement of fishery laws in municipal waters including the conservation of mangroves
- Information services which include investments and job placement information systems, tax and marketing information systems, and maintenance of public library
- Infrastructure facilities intended primarily to service the needs of the residents of the municipality and which are funded out of municipal funds including, but not limited to municipal roads and bridges; school buildings and other facilities for public elementary and secondary schools; clinics, health centers and other health facilities necessary to carry out health services; communal irrigation, SWIP and other similar projects; fish ports; artesian wells, spring development, rainwater collectors and water supply systems; seawalls, dikes, drainage and sewerage, and flood control; traffic signals and road signs and similar facilities
- Public markets, slaughterhouses and other municipal enterprises

Barangay
- Agricultural support services which include planting materials distribution system and operation of farm produce collection and buying stations;
- Maintenance of barangay roads and bridges and water supply systems
- Infrastructure facilities such as multi-purpose hall, multi-purpose pavement, plaza, sports center and other similar facilities
- Information and reading center
- Satellite or public market, where viable

Notice the longer list in the case of the municipality.  It is at this point where economies of scale is realized and externality effects most probably transcend barangay boundaries but not municipal boundaries.  The next question that comes to mind is the role of National Government, specifically the DA and its attached agencies.  It would be too difficult to cite an example of agricultural investment that realizes economies of scale at that level.  But there are a number where the externality effects transcend provinces, e.g., basic R&D, policy and regulation, large-scale irrigation systems with multiple uses, control of transnational diseases, etc.  There are also others that require cooperation among different implementors, but should probably be directed by NG, e.g., national information network, human resource development, etc.  Needless to say, NG should always be prepared to extend technical assistance in the design and operations of agricultural investments, on request.

### Basic Principles in Public Investment Programming
---
Even as we recognize the purpose for which the investment is being proposed and the role it will play in enhancing the effectiveness of government to perform its functions, there should always be a conscious effort to promote economic efficiency.  By this we mean the extent to which all the resources of the economy are being utilized.  We need to be conscious of the following principles:

1. Development should be defined in terms of enhanced benefits to people – consumers and producers alike.

2. There should be utmost recognition for the primacy of private initiative to effect development.  This can come in the form of increased labor supply, innovations, adoption of modern technology, use of more production inputs, conscious decision to save, etc.  Public investment is undertaken to provide the enabling conditions for private initiative to be realized.  In fact, even in this, the better alternative is for the private sector to take on the investment.

3. Public investment, like any other investment, is meant to improve on the status quo.  The second principle to be observed is: ”If it ain’t broke, why fix it; but if it’s always broken, why not fix it?”  But to answer this question, we should be able to describe the status quo.  In short, what is the purpose of the investment being proposed in relation to the current production process?

4. Resources available today are more valuable than the promise of benefits to be enjoyed at some time in the future.  Public investments dip into the same resource pool as social and even private investments.  Now, the latter set of investments results in immediate private returns.  Therefore, public investments need to be justified in comparison to other possible uses of the resources needed to produce the public investment.

5. There is always more than one way to provide a good and/or a service.  The alternative to direct public provision is the provision of incentives or enabling conditions to private providers.  In choosing among the alternatives, we should favor the strategic investments or the one that results in the highest efficiency without worsening inequality.

6. Application of the Pareto compensation principle:  the result of the public investment should be such that the gainers are able to compensate the “losers” and still be better off.   Natural resource management projects provide the best illustrations.  For instance, in coastal resource management projects, fisherfolks are disallowed from fishing in a certain area.  They are made to rehabilitate mangroves and coral reefs.  The estimate is that it will take about 10 years for these habitats to be fully rehabilitated after which time, fishing can be allowed.  For sure, the fish catch will be more but they will have to wait 10 years to benefit from it, plus there is always the possibility that the fisherfolks from the nearby communities will be the ones to benefit since the fishes are mobile.  They may breed in the protected area but swim to another when grown up.  The project has to design a scheme to compensate the fisherfolks from their losses, yet fully aware that the benefits will most likely accrue to them anyway.

Any public investment takes away resource from another possible public investment.  A million peso spent on irrigation systems is equivalent to forgoing the construction of about 3-4 classrooms.  We should be able to justify to the schoolchildren and their parents that the benefits to be derived from the irrigation system is worth their inconvenience of having to study in dilapidated, poorly lit and overcrowded classrooms.

### Re-defining Public Investment Programming
---

We are now ready to re-define public investment programming for the agriculture sector, taking off from the previous definition.

> Public investment programming is the task of formulating the broad, aggregate portfolio of public investments, where the portfolio is composed of goods and services necessary for government to perform its functions of promoting efficiency, equity, stability and representation in the international community in support of optimal rural and agricultural growth.
