## Chapter 5 Understand the Setting

This step provides the background for which the public investment is being programmed.  This needs to be done in two levels – macro and micro.  By macro, we mean the national and regional levels, agriculture in relation to the other sectors, and other crucial indicators.  By micro, we mean provincial and even municipal, as data permits.

In general, we need to analyze effectiveness and efficiency indicators – (1) the effectiveness of the sector in meeting the needs and wants of each and every individual and household – whether these individuals derive their incomes from the agriculture or non-agriculture sectors, and (2) the efficiency of the sector in utilizing inputs.  In other words, we want to answer the questions:

a.	Has the sector been effective in meeting the demands of society?  Going into the medium term, are there indications that the sector will be effective?

b.	Has the sector been efficient in utilizing inputs?  Going into the medium term, are there indications that the sector will be efficient?

### List of Indicators

The National Income Accounts provides the following disaggregation of the Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry sector:

Agriculture Industry

a. Agriculture
- Palay
- Corn
- Coconut including copra
- Sugarcane
- Banana
- Other crops
- Livestock
- Poultry
- Agricultural activities and services

b. Fishery

c. Forestry

The information given is the Gross Value Added (GVA) in constant and current prices  and is available annually at the national and regional levels.

For each subsector in agriculture, we are interested in the following: 

Outcome:
- Share of GVA in agriculture to GDP,  
- Contribution to employment,
- Contribution to foreign exchange earnings and expenses
- Reliability of supply
- Price and volatility of basic commodities (commonly consumed)

Impact:
- Prevalence of malnutrition
- Incidence of poverty in the sector

Efficiency of the sector or subsector in utilizing inputs, 
- Gross Value Added in Agriculture per unit land 
- Gross Value Added in Agriculture per unit labor 
- Contribution to foreign exchange earnings and savings

### Considerations in Analyzing the Different Indicators

The analysis can take on at least four forms, but there are certain measurement caveats that we need to be aware of.

- The first, and the simplest, is to compute the usual descriptive statistics – average, standard deviation, minimum and maximum.  Of course this assumes that there is more than one “observation”.  The observations may correspond to regional or provincial figures.
- We can also compare these statistics against other countries (for the national level), then compare regional level statistics against each other, but making sure that the statistics are indeed comparable across space.  This becomes a problem if we are comparing value of different countries and not quantity or volume of output.  Usually, however, it is easier to obtain data on the former (like the National Income Accounts) rather than on the latter.  An option is to convert the output values in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.  The World Bank produces the time series on PPP .  The PPP gives us the exchange rate where the two currencies can purchase the same basket of goods and services from the two countries.  Suppose an item costs $ 1.00 if bought in the US but the same item can be bought in the Philippines for only Php 10.00, then the PPP is 1:10 instead of the usual exchange rate of 1:50.  In effect, the PPP considers the differences in standard of living.  

  Another effect that needs to be considered is the size of the agricultural sector, say as proxied by the size of agricultural land.  More than just comparing means, we can even model a simple relationship between quantity of agricultural production and agricultural land.  The regression line captures the average level of agricultural production for a given size of agricultural land.  Therefore, points above the line can be considered “achievers” while points under the line can be considered “under-performers.”

- Another form of the analysis looks at trends over time.  For this technique, the performance statistics should be comparable over time.  As before, the problem does not arise when we deal with statistics on quantity.  If, on the other hand, we need to deal with values of production, we should consider values expressed in real prices.  This is sometimes referred to as constant prices, as opposed to nominal or current prices.  Production value is simply the unit price multiplied by the quantity produced.  Thus, it increases with an increase in unit price or an increase in the quantity produced or both.  What is more meaningful to us is the increase in the quantity produced.  Expressing the values in real terms eliminates the effects of prices.  

  What could be more useful, though, is to forecast the performance of the sector, at least over the medium term.  The principle is that “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!”  We need to know how things will be if we do not intervene.  This can be done using sophisticated forecasting models.  Absent this model and the expertise necessary to run it, the simple trend analysis technique discussed in Annex II can qualify even for just a first iteration.

- The fourth technique is a comparison of performance across space and over time.  This means that the caveats discussed above all need to be considered here.

### Example 1: Profile of the Agriculture Sector in 2005

In terms of effectiveness of the sector to meet the demands of society:

The share of agricultural Gross Value Added to GDP has been dwindling, from 24% in 1988 to 18% in 2005.  In terms of growth rate, it has been growing just a bit higher than the growth in population, 2.4% annually. Its share to employment has also declined, from 40% to 33% over the same period.  

The contribution of Agriculture to foreign exchange has also declined.  Food export as a share to total export has declined from 22% to 2%.  While the share of food imports to merchandise imports has decreased from 10% in the late 80s to 7% in 2003, this latter figure is still higher than Thailand’s.

Poverty incidence in the sector remains high and may have actually increased, 53.1% in 1991 to 54.7% in 2003.  We need to qualify this finding especially considering that agriculture is the employer of last resort.  There may be differences in poverty status by class of worker.  The Family Income and Expenditure Survey allows us to differentiate by class of worker, only as far as the household head is concerned.  With this caveat, we find that among the principal farmers, poverty incidence is about 55%, even higher than the incidence found among hired labor and unpaid family workers.

Figure 2.  Poverty Incidence by Class of Worker, Agriculture Sector Only

![figure 2](statics/figure_2.png "Figure 2.  Poverty Incidence by Class of Worker, Agriculture Sector Only")

Meanwhile, malnutrition and nutrient deficiency rates among preschoolers has remained high, at least 30%, for over a decade now.  

#### In terms of efficiency in the utilization of inputs

Table 3 below shows that the non-agriculture sector outperforms the agriculture sector in producing output per unit of land by more than 10 times.  The average annual increase in productivity is also slower, 2.7% in contrast to the other sectors, 3.1%.  This last profile is counter-intuitive since we expect the sector that starts off from a low base should grow much faster than the sector that starts off from a higher base.

Table 3.  Land Productivity of the Agriculture and Non-Agriculture Sectors

![table 3](statics/table_3.png "Table 3.  Land Productivity of the Agriculture and Non-Agriculture Sectors")

The following charts the trend in labor productivity across the major production sectors:

![figure 3](statics/figure_3.png "Figure 3. Average Labor Productivity by Industry (in 1995 prices)")

We observe that the agriculture sector exhibits the lowest productivity level in labor and that it has not improved much for more than a decade now.  

### Example 2. Comparing the Regional Performance in Agriculture with consideration for Differences in Size of Agricultural Land

The following chart estimates a simple regression model of the share of the region’s agricultural GVA to total and share of the region’s agricultural land to total in 2003.

We first observe that the line is less than perfect and is able to explain less than 47% of the variability.  Obviously, the size of agricultural land alone cannot adequately predict agricultural production of the region.  This is actually a welcome result.  It implies that the size of fixed inputs explains less than half the observed production.  The quality of the fixed inputs and most probably, the quality of variable inputs can explain the rest.  

Figure 4.  Share to Agriculture Gross Value Added by Share to Agricultural Land

![figure 4](statics/figure_4.png "Figure 4. Share to Agriculture Gross Value Added by Share to Agricultural Land")

The line represents the expected performance of the region with the given size of agricultural land.  Those above the line are the achievers.  From the highest performers, these are regions IV, III, XI, VI and I.  Those below the line are performing below expectations.  From the lowest performers, these are the regions of CARAGA, ARMM, VIII, V, XII, and X.  Those performing according to expectations are IX, II, VII, CAR and NCR.  We should be particularly concerned with regions X, XII, V and VIII.  These regions have above average share in total agricultural land, but have contributed less than the expected share to agricultural GVA.
